# FindYourSquad

SquadUp is a gaming matchmaker that finds teammates based on ability level and play-style.

SquadUp's matching algorithm takes your personal specifications and finds the perfect teammates for a variety of games, including Apex Legends and Among us. After putting in you search criteria, a user is presented with a list of groups-in-progress. They can view the stats of players currently in the group and decide if they are a good fit. The user requests to join the group, is approved by the group leader, and is let in. Once accepted into a group, players can communicate through chat to trade gamertags and discuss strategy. When everyone is ready,they log on and play.
